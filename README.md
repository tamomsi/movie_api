# movie_api

Welcome to MyFlix API

In this project I have built the server-side component of a “movies” web application, which provides users with access to information about different movies, directors and genres.
Users are able to sign up, update their personal information and create a list of their favourite movies or remove a movie from their list of favourites.

In order to built this web application I made sure that:
The API is a Node.js and Express application, it uses REST architecture, with URL endpoints corresponding to the certain data operations and at least three middleware modules, such as the body-parser package for reading data from requests and morgan for logging. MyFlix API uses a “package.json” file and the database is built using MongoDB. The business logic is modelled with Mongoose. MyFlix API provides movie information in JSON format, The JavaScript code is error-free and the API is tested in Postman. 
The API includes user authentication and authorization code and data validation logic. It meets data security regulations. Myflix API source code is deployed to GitHub and to Heroku.
